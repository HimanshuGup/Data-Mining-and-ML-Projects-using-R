ML Models

I have applied 5 Machine Learning models on three datasets related to different domains. 

The first dataset is about Credit card fraud detection, in which principal component analyses has already been done 
because its confidential data related to financial accounts, as this is a classification problem I have applied
SVM with various kernels and Na√Øve Bayes machine learning algorithm. Dataset has about 300 thousand records with
imbalanced classification so used various sampling techniques.Some SVM kernel performed better than others. 

The second dataset is about crop production where I was predicting the production based on Area for different districts using linear regression and regression tree ML methods, this dataset has a lot of categorical variables therefore dummy coding has been used. Regression modelwas found more satisfactory as compare to linear one. 

The third dataset is about online store/shop transactions of certain period which I have analyzed and applied clustering technique (unsupervised learning) for predicting consumer behavior based on together purchased items.
